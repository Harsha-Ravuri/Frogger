# Description<br>
This is my version of the famous game frogger. If you play carefully, you can jump on the truck, or you get hit by it and die. Be careful when jumping on the logs, they may be slippery.

# Changes made since demo
<br>
During the demo, I had most of my functionality, but the problem was that the frog would move indefinitely to the right once it touched a log. After the demo I fixed that. I also made it so that it doesn't need to be run in an IDE. I then made the code look more readable. The most important change was making all the images base 64 strings. This is why the file "imagesused.js" that I'm submitting is important for this. However, this will be changed soon to just use the images hosted on gitHub. Doing so is a lot more efficient than using base 64 strings.
